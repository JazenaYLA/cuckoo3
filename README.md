## About
Cuckoo3 is an open-source tool to test suspicious files or links in a controlled
environment.

It will test them in sandboxed platform emulator(s) and generate a report, showing what the files 
or websites did during the test.

> ⚠️ You can currently only set up Cuckoo3 on Linux(Ubuntu) 
machines and run Windows sandboxes. 
Check our [Cuckoo3 requirements](https://cuckoo-hatch.cert.ee/static/docs/introduction/cuckoo/)

You can see it in action at our [online Cuckoo3 Sandbox](https://cuckoo-hatch.cert.ee/).
